# Product Requirements Document: HTTP Source Connector

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for developing an HTTP Source Connector that replicates the functionality of Confluent Cloud's HTTP Source V2 Connector. The connector will enable seamless integration between HTTP/HTTPS APIs and Apache Kafka, allowing organizations to stream data from various HTTP endpoints into Kafka topics with enterprise-grade reliability and performance.

## Problem Statement

- Support multiple authentication mechanisms (Basic, Bearer, OAuth 2.0, API Key)
- Ensure at-least-once delivery guarantees
- Enable schema-based data formats with Schema Registry integration
- Implement configurable retry and error handling mechanisms

### Secondary Goals
- Support multiple API endpoints per connector instance
- Provide OpenAPI specification-based configuration
- Enable field-level encryption for sensitive data
- Implement offset management for data recovery and deduplication
