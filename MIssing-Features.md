Missing Features & Improvements
1. JMX Metrics and Monitoring
Status: MISSING

The PRD specifically mentions "Expose JMX metrics for monitoring" but I don't see any JMX MBean implementations in the codebase.

Recommended Implementation:

Create JMX MBeans for connector metrics
Expose performance metrics (throughput, latency, error rates)
Expose circuit breaker states
Expose cache hit rates and performance optimization metrics
2. Health Check Endpoints
Status: MISSING

The PRD requires "HTTP endpoints for health monitoring" but this is not implemented.

Recommended Implementation:

Add REST endpoints for health checks
Provide status information for each API endpoint
Include circuit breaker states and authentication status
3. OpenAPI 3.0+ Specification Support
Status: MISSING

The PRD mentions "Configuration via OpenAPI 3.0+ specifications" but there's no OpenAPI integration.

Recommended Implementation:

Add OpenAPI specification parser
Auto-generate connector configurations from OpenAPI specs
Support for automatic schema discovery
4. Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) Integration
Status: PARTIAL

While error handling exists, there's no clear DLQ implementation for failed records.

Recommended Implementation:

Complete DLQ integration in AdvancedErrorHandler
Add configuration for DLQ topic names
Implement proper error record serialization
5. Enhanced SSL/TLS Configuration
Status: BASIC

The current SSL implementation is basic and missing several enterprise features.

Recommended Improvements:

Add custom keystore/truststore support
Certificate validation options
Support for mutual TLS authentication
SSL certificate rotation capabilities
6. Advanced Pagination Support
Status: PARTIAL

While offset managers exist, some pagination patterns are incomplete.

Recommended Improvements:

Enhanced cursor-based pagination
Support for link header pagination
Automatic pagination detection from API responses
7. Rate Limiting and Throttling
Status: MISSING

No built-in rate limiting to respect API limits.

Recommended Implementation:

Add configurable rate limiting per API
Support for different rate limiting algorithms (token bucket, sliding window)
Automatic backoff on rate limit responses (429 status codes)
8. Schema Registry Integration Enhancements
Status: BASIC

While schema formats are supported, advanced Schema Registry features are missing.

Recommended Improvements:

Schema evolution compatibility checks
Multiple schema contexts support
Schema caching for performance
Automatic schema inference from API responses
9. Advanced Template Variable Support
Status: BASIC

The current template system is basic and could be enhanced.

Recommended Improvements:

Support for date/time functions (e.g., ${now}, ${yesterday})
Environment variable interpolation
Mathematical operations in templates
Conditional template expressions
10. Comprehensive Integration Tests
Status: NEEDS EXPANSION

While some integration tests exist, coverage could be improved.

Recommended Additions:

OAuth2 flow integration tests
API chaining integration tests
Performance optimization tests
Schema Registry integration tests
Error handling scenario tests
11. Documentation and Examples
Status: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

Recommended Additions:

Complete API reference documentation
More configuration examples for different use cases
Troubleshooting guides
Performance tuning guides
Migration guides from other connectors
12. Configuration Validation Enhancements
Status: GOOD BUT CAN IMPROVE

Recommended Improvements:

Add JSON schema validation for configurations
Configuration templates for common scenarios
Configuration diff and migration tools
Real-time configuration validation
13. Advanced Security Features
Status: PARTIAL

Recommended Additions:

Support for HashiCorp Vault integration
AWS IAM role-based authentication
Azure Active Directory integration
Credential rotation capabilities
14. Performance Optimizations
Status: GOOD BUT CAN IMPROVE

Recommended Enhancements:

HTTP/2 support for better performance
Connection pooling optimizations
Async HTTP client implementation
Memory usage optimization for large payloads
15. Operational Features
Status: MISSING

Recommended Additions:

Connector state management APIs
Runtime configuration updates
Hot reloading of configurations
Graceful shutdown improvements
